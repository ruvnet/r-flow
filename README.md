# React Flow JavaScript starter

We've put together this template to serve as a starting point for folks
interested in React Flow. You can use this sandbox to experiment with the library
or share with us a bug report or issue.

**JavaScript not your thing?** We also have a TypeScript starter template, just for
you!

## Getting up and running

You can fork and edit this sandbox in your browser. If you want to work offline or are
looking for a template for real app development, check out our
[Vite React Flow template](https://github.com/xyflow/vite-react-flow-template/tree/main).

## Things to try:

- Create a new custom node inside `src/nodes/` (don't forget to export it from `src/nodes/index.js`).
- Change how things look by [overriding some of the built-in classes](https://reactflow.dev/learn/customization/theming#overriding-built-in-classes).
- Add a layouting library to [position your nodes automatically](https://reactflow.dev/learn/layouting/layouting)
